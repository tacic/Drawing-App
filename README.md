# Drawing-App

Basic drawing app

You can only chose color and thickness of a pencil for drawing.

It fully works in Chrome, in Firefox it doesn't change color and does not work at all in IE - you only see picture but can't draw anything.

I will add shape drawing tools, fill bucket or similar stuff from paint...
